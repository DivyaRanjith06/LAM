Project Description
This project was developed as part of the TWorks LAM Challenge, held in November 2024.
It captures frames from a live camera feed, detects object outlines using contour-based image processing, and arranges the detected shapes compactly on a virtual canvas. The processed contours are then exported as both a PNG image for visual layout and a DXF file for use in CAD/CAM applications.

Key Features:
Real-time image capture via webcam.
Adaptive thresholding for robust contour detection.
Compact nesting algorithm to minimize layout space.
Export to .png and .dxf formats for visual and CAD-ready outputs.

This solution is ideal for applications such as:
Automated material cutting
Layout optimization in manufacturing
Digital fabrication workflows.
